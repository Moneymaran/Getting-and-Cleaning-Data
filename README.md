It takes the given train and test data sets and does the following:

* Merge the train and test data sets.
* Extract only the measurements on mean and standard deviation.
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a new, independent data set with the average for each variable for each activity and each subject.

It finally writes out the output to a .txt file.
